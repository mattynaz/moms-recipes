# Mom's Recipes
A place for mom to keep and share all her recipes ü•ò. To use the site, you just need to know how to do three things:
1. ‚úçÔ∏è create a new recipe, 
2. üì≤ publish a recipe, 
3. üñã and edit or delete a recipe. 

 Below is how to do each of those in 5 steps (and a markdown cheatsheet for mom üòó).

## Create a new recipe
1. Go to the [recipes](recipes) folder. All recipes are stored here.
2. At the top right, click on `Add file > Create new file`.
3. At the top, enter the name of the dish then `.md` to say you're making a markdown file. (For example, `shepards-pie.md`. Make sure there are no spaces).
4. As you're writing the recipe, check the `Preview` tab to see roughly how the recipe will look.
5. Click `Commit new file` at the bottom. (Don't fill out the two text boxes above this button because they are optional).

## Publish a recipe
1. Go to the [recipes](recipes) folder.
2. Click on the [published recipes](recipes/published_recipes.md) file `published_recipes.md`
3. Click on the pencil ‚úèÔ∏è at the top right to edit.
4. When adding a new recipe, follow this template (**The ID must be the same as the recipe's file name.** If the file is named `shepards-pie.md`, the ID must be `shepards-pie`. If you don't want tags, don't include the entire third line):
```md
# Shepard's Pie
- id: shepards-pie
- tags: veggie, vegan, pie, gluten free
```
5. Click `Commit changes` to save.


## Edit or delete recipe
1. Go to the [recipes](recipes) folder.
2. Click on a recipe.
3. Click on the pencil ‚úèÔ∏è at the top right to edit or click on the trash can üóë to delete.
4. Hit `Commit changes` at the bottom to confirm the changes.
5. If you deleted a recipe, go back to the [published recipes](recipes/published_recipes.md) file and delete the recipe.
