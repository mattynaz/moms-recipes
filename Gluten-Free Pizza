Ingredients:, 
2 1/4 Gluten Free Flour, I use "Bob Mills Gluten-Free 1 to 1 Baking Flour". This flour has xanthan gum.
1/2 Teaspoon Salt
1 egg (room tempreture)
2 Tablespoon Oil, I use Olive Oil.
2 Teaspoon dry Yeast
3/4 Water
2 Teaspoon Apple Cider Vingar
2 Teaspoon sugar or honey

Direction:
Add sugar/honey in a measuring cup, add 3/4 water, microwave for 35-40 seconds. The tempreture must be luke warm. If too hot, will kill he yeast.
Add yeast to your sweetened warm water, stir and put aside. Yeast wil start to rise and bubble.

In your mixing bowl, add flour, salt and mix using Dough Hook attachment.
In a bowl mix Oil, Apple Cide Vingar and egg, mix well.
Add liquid mixture to flour and continue mixing on Medium speed.
Add Yeast and Liquid to your mixture and continue to mix on Medium speed.
Continue until all ingredients are mixed well, making sure flour on bottom of bowl is mixed in the dough.
Once all ingredients are mixed, turn speed to High for last 3-4 minutes.
Make a dough ball and cover tighly in the bowl leave outside for 2-3 hours for the dough to rise.
After dough is left outside to rise, you are ready to bake the dough into delicious Pizza.
Turn oven to 520 F (yes, pretty hot)
Roll out to your into a baking pan. I divide into two, there is a crispier bake on the crust.
Use extra flour to work with the dough as it is very wet.
Shape your pizza(s) on baking pan.
Once your over is ready, it will take awhile to heat up to 520, bake the Pizza crust without toppings.
Depending on your oven, bake for 12-15 minutes or until dough begins to bubble on top and slight crisp on edge crust.
Remove the Pizza Crust from the over carefully, oven is really hot.
Add your sauce, cheese and any topping and return to oven to bake until done as you like it.
I like my Pizza crispy on edges, this crust is perfect for me.
